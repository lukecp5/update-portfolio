# update-portfolio
This is my development portfolio website. It showcases some of my best work in the fields of design and development. I completely redesigned it from the portfolio that I had before. This time I used Bootstrap, Font Awesome, JavaScript, and other utilities to achieve a clean and polished user interface that looks great across all devices.
